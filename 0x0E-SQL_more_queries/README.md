# 0x0E. SQL - More queries

## Project Description

This SQL project provides a comprehensive tutorial on MySQL database management, covering essential concepts and techniques for users at all levels. Participants will learn to create and manage users, assign privileges, and enforce data integrity using constraints like NOT NULL and UNIQUE. They'll gain an understanding of primary and foreign keys, essential for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables. The project also delves into advanced querying techniques, including retrieving data from multiple tables using JOIN operations and utilizing subqueries for complex data manipulation. Participants will also learn the difference between JOIN and UNION operations and how to leverage them effectively in querying databases. Through hands-on tasks, participants will develop practical skills that are vital for database administrators and developers alike.
