# 0x0D. SQL - Introduction

## Introduction

Welcome to our comprehensive project designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of databases and SQL, along with practical tasks to reinforce your learning. In this project, we'll cover essential topics such as understanding databases and SQL, basic MySQL tutorials, and fundamental SQL statements including Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML).

Throughout the project, you'll learn how to execute basic queries using both SQL and relational algebra (RA), explore SQL techniques such as functions and subqueries, and understand the crucial distinctions between backticks and apostrophes in SQL.

We'll also provide you with a handy MySQL cheat sheet for quick reference, delve into the syntax of SQL statements in MySQL 8.0, and guide you through the process of installing MySQL on Ubuntu 20.04, ensuring you have the necessary setup to follow along with the tasks seamlessly.

Whether you're a beginner looking to grasp the fundamentals or someone seeking to reinforce their SQL skills, this project will provide you with the knowledge and hands-on experience necessary to navigate the world of databases and SQL effectively. Let's dive in and start exploring the exciting realm of data management with MySQL!
